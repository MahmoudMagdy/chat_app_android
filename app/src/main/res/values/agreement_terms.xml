        <item>ChatApp Accounts</item>
        <item>- You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content on our website, without having a ChatApp account. However, you do need a ChatApp account to use some features. With a ChatApp account, you may be able to like videos, follow other users, create your own videos and share it, and more.

        \n\n5. use the Service to distribute unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass solicitations (spam);

        \n\n6. cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the Service, including by paying people or providing them with incentives to increase a video’s views, likes, or dislikes, or to increase a user’s followers, or otherwise manipulate metrics;

        \n\n7. misuse any reporting, flagging, complaint, dispute, or appeals process, including by making groundless, vexatious, or frivolous submissions;

        \n\n8. use the Service to view or listen to Content other than for personal, non-commercial use (for example, you may not publicly screen videos or stream music from the Service); or

        \n\n9. use the Service to: (a) sell any advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on, around, or within the Service or Content, other than those allowed (such as compliant product placements); or (b) sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or application that only contains Content from the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage where ChatApp videos are the only content of value).</item>
        <item>Reservation</item>
        <item>Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of ChatApp or the respective rights holders. This means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Content you access (including any branding used on or displayed in the Service).</item>
        <item>Changes to the Service</item>
        <item>ChatApp is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and features, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. We will always consider and balance the impact of such changes on the use of the Service. Whenever reasonably possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make material changes to our Service that will have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, there will be times when we need to make such changes without notice, such as where we need to take action to improve the security and operability of our Service, prevent abuse, or meet our legal requirements.</item>
<!--        <item>Your Content and Conduct</item>-->
        <item>Uploading Content</item>
        <item>If you have a ChatApp account, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</item>
        <item>Rights you Grant</item>
        <item>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to ChatApp and other users of the Service, as described below.</item>
        <item>Licence to ChatApp</item>
        <item>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to ChatApp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it) for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.</item>
        <item>Licence to Other Users</item>
        <item>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, and perform it) only as enabled by a feature of the Service.</item>
        <item>Duration of Licence</item>
        <item>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the licences will terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your removal, or the law requires otherwise.  For example, removal of Content by you does not require ChatApp to: (a) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for legal purposes.</item>
        <item>Removing Your Content</item>
        <item>You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</item>
        <item>Removal of Content By ChatApp</item>
        <item>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to ChatApp, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for ChatApp or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, ChatApp or our Affiliates.</item>
        <item>Copyright Protection</item>
        <item>If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.
            \nWe respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our ChatApp Copyright Center. ChatApp\'s policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</item>

        <item>Terminations by You</item>
        <item>You may stop using the Service at any time.</item>
        <item>Terminations and Suspensions by ChatApp for Cause</item>
        <item>ChatApp may suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct that creates liability or harm to any user, other third party, ChatApp or our Affiliates.</item>
        <item>Terminations by ChatApp for Service Changes</item>
        <item>ChatApp may terminate your access to all or part of the Service if ChatApp reasonably believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.</item>
        <item>Notice for Termination or Suspension</item>
        <item>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by ChatApp unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for ChatApp or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, ChatApp or our Affiliates. Where ChatApp is terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</item>
        <item>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</item>
        <item>If your account is terminated or your account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account in our website, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use.</item>
<!--        <item>About Software in our Service</item>-->
        <item>Downloadable Software</item>
        <item>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the ChatApp application), you give permission for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, ChatApp gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software provided to you by ChatApp as part of the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by ChatApp, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have ChatApp’s written permission.</item>
